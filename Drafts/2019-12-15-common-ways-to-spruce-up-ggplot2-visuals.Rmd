I am making this post to serve as a collection of functions and usecases in order to save time googling around for them when I need them in a pinch. 

#### Use the scales package to better format your axis

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
salary = read_csv('https://data.baltimorecity.gov/resource/6xv6-e66h.csv')
salary %>% 
        group_by(jobtitle) %>% 
        summarize(n = sum(!is.na(gross)), 
                  med_pay = median(gross, na.rm = T)) %>% 
        filter(n > 20)
```


```{r}
salary %>% 
        filter(jobtitle == 'Police Officer Trainee')
        

```
